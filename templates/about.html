    <h1>Orlando Blagrove</h1>
    <p>I am an enthusiastic person with the mentality of never giving up. I love computers and I am a techie, which is how I became interested in learning to code. I want to better myself as much as possible, one step at a time. Additionally, I am a web developer, photographer, filmmaker, and content creator.</p>
